This document summarizes how the script works. Details about the used data, the necessary transformations and the meaning of the final data can be found in CodeBook.md.

The script is composed of one file. It contains:
- Sections: Each section is separated with the comment block "### PART X: DESCRIPTION ###" from other sections. It contains subsections.
- Subsections: Subsections are introduced to give the reader a better oversight. A subsection starts with "# SUBSECTION". Start of another subsection marks the end of the previous one.
- Transformations: Transformations within a subsection are introduced to improve the readability of the code. A transformation starts with "# transformation" string. Start of another transformation marks the end of the previous one.
